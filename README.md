# Juicy Springs

Something a lot of young indies skip over is the "juice factor" of their game. Simple, bland transitions and movement leaves the game feeling boring. In this tutorial repository and [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/6mR7NSsi91Y) you'll learn about Springs how to use them, and also get a framework to use them in your game today! 

Springs allow us to move, rotate, and scale objects in a, well, springy way that just ends up feeling a lot more satisfying than the simple Vector3.Lerp or Quaternion.Slerp you may be using today. They also achieve this without any animation keyframes or Animation Curve definitions so they're really fast to implement! 

They're not just limited to scaling, translating, or rotating objects either. You can use this on any arbitrary value. Why not fade an object in using a springy alpha? Need to transition a color? Maybe that might feel better if it were springy! 
Not all objects always need to be springy, but probably you'll find something in your game that just feels better if it had a little more juice!
